// src/app/actions.ts
'use server';

// This file is now largely deprecated as the core logic has moved to /api/compare-orders/route.ts
// It's kept here for potential future server actions if needed, or can be removed if no longer used.

// Example of how a server action might look if you needed one unrelated to the main comparison flow:
/*
export async function someOtherAction(formData: FormData) {
  // ... server-side logic ...
  console.log("Some other action was called");
  return { message: "Other action completed" };
}
*/
